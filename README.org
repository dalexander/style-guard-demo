* What?
The intention here is to get source code formatting automatically
checked and guaranteed before checkin.

* Why?
- Automate style-guide compliance to avoid squabbles
- Post-checkin reformatting binges mess up history.  It's best to get
  it right from the get-go.


* How?
See the Makefile---there are rules there appropriate for a git
pre-push hook to check formatting, a CI testing hook to check
formatting, and for actually performing the reformatting.


* Tips
- We should *not* reformat bundled third-party code as it will make it
  difficult to diff with upstream.  Put such code in a subdirectory
  with its own .clangformat file containing: "BasedOnStyle: None" to
  disable formatting.

- If clang-format mangles something (for example, a comment block with
  ASCII art or significant whitespace), you can protect a block using
  "// clang-format off" and then "// clang-format on".
